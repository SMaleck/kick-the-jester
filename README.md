# **Kick The Jester**

That Jester was especially boring today. Kick him out as far as you can!

Send him to the outer edges of the kingdom, so he never comes back! 
And if your swift kick is not enough, throw tomatoes at him while he flies, so he flies even further!

Kick the Jester is an open source tossing game made in Unity.

## *Getting Started*
1. Clone the repository and open the project with Unity
2. From the Unity Editor open any C# source file, so that the `.sln` gets generated correctly
3. Open the Asset Store in Unity and import all required Assets ([see list below](#*Paid_Unity_Asset_Store_Resources*))

**NOTE:** Paid Unity Asset Store plugins are not part of the repository for obvious reasons. You will have to import them manually.

### Starting the Project in Unity
The Game needs to be started from the `Title` scene, since this initialises the basic layers.
You can use the hotkey `CTRL + L` from anywhere to start the correct scene.
