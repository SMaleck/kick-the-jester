# **Kick The Jester**

A tossing game in Unity.

## *Getting Started*
1. Clone the repository and open the project with Unity
2. From the Unity Editor open any C# source file, so that the `.sln` gets generated correctly
3. Open the Asset Store in Unity and import all required Assets ([see list below](#*Unity_Asset_Store_Resources*))

**NOTE:** Paid Unity Asset Store plugins are not part of the repository for obvious reasons. You will have to import them manually.

### Starting the Project in Unity
The Game needs to be started from the `Title` scene, since this initialises the basic layers.
You can use the hotkey `CTRL + L` from anywhere to start the correct scene.
